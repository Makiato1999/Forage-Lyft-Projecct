#### Your task is to refactoring the codebase, which you should consider design pattern, such as factory pattern, abstract factory pattern, etc.
- abstract class and abstract method
- static method
- factory pattern & abstract factory pattern
- strategy pattern (i am not sure whether it used this pattern or not)
- python model import and package import
- inherit
#### All task2(progress2) resources(python code for answer) are from [here](https://github.com/vagabond-systems/forage-lyft-task-2-model-answer), I forked this repository and pushed my codes [here](https://github.com/Makiato1999/forage-lyft-starter-repo).
